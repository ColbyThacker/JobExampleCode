ExampleOne is structured as such. The source code given is an example solution to a TSP problem given in my A.I. class at University. We were given a text document with a list of points and we had to generate a visual showing the shortest path, but the caveat was that we had to use a specific "greedy" algorithm given to us in class. In the following folder provided I give the source code along with a examples of the generated console in which I write out the points in order of the path generated and I provide a screenshot of an example visual generated. This project doesn't showcase much of my thought process when coding because of the rigid structure but still manages to showcase how I structure my code in general and how I would structure my code at a workplace.
